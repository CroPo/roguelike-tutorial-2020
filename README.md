This is my participation to the Roguelike Tutorial of [/r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) of summer 2020. 
I chose to follow along using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) as programming language, and the [zircon](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/) library.

Every part of the tutorial will be a separate tag. Additionally, there is a writeup of my experience for every step in 
the `docs` directory:

- [Part 0 - Setting up](docs/Part0_SettingUp.md)
- [Part 1 - Drawing the ‘@’ symbol and moving it around](docs/Part1_DrawingThePlayerAndMovingAround.md)
- [Part 2 - The generic Entity, the render functions, and the map](docs/Part2_TheGenericEntityTheRenderFunctionsAndTheMap.md)

Again, feel free to comment every piece of code. The main purpose for my participation is to learn Kotlin, so anything helps.
