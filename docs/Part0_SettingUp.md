#Part 0 - Setting up

## Prior knowledge

Well, starting with this tutorial, I pretty much just know that Kotlin exists. I didn't read a
tutorial or book about it before, but I'll read one while doing the tutorial now. 
[Kotlin in action](https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action) to be exact.

Same with zircon - I didn't read the tutorial beforehand, I just try to get what I need when 
I need it out of the documentation.

I'm pretty familiar with gradle and Java, so all of that shouldn't be too much of a problem.

## Intentions

The main intention of my participation is to learn Kotlin. It worked well for me back in 2018,
when I pretty much did the same thing, but with Rust, and since Kotlin is getting more a thing
where I work I thought it might be a good opportunity to participate on the tutorial series 
again.

## Setting up the project

There's not much to say about setting up the project. IntelliJ pretty much does everything for 
you.
